# CS252 JavaFX Starter Template

Use this template repository to create your own project repository. Edit the Main.java file and replace existing template code with your own. Use the javafx:run command with maven, either in a maven run profile in intellij or from the command-line, to run your project (try it first with this template code). Make sure you're using JDK17 or later.
